###  Seek Out *Topic Experts*
The *Expert Network Map* allows users to visually identify *Topic Experts* in the Fab community. *Topic Experts* are Fab Academy students who are frequently referenced by peers. Fab Academy students often link each other's websites in their documentation, and mapping these connections creates a network intertwined across labs, years, and countries. The more times a student is referenced correlates with expertise level in specific subject areas. For current Fab Academy students, it can be extremely helpful to quickly identify *Topic Experts* to access their documentation for reference. Interacting with the Map can determine *Topic Experts* by year and specific labs. Once *Topic Experts* are found, clicking on their circle redirects the user to their Fab Academy Documentation Website.

 
The *Expert Network Map* allows users to navigate the massive web of interconnected students and highlights *Topics Experts* dating back to 2018. Each Fab Academy student is represented by a circle. Drag around different students to play with the data and gain insight into the interconnectedness of the Fab community.

The larger a student's circle, the more times they have been referenced. Hover over a circle to see the student's name, and click on it to open their documentation website. Click the tabs on the left to filter by topic area; click different years on the bottom left circle to highlight students from that year; use the dropdown on the top right to highlight students from certain Fab Labs; and use the dial on the bottom right to set a minimum number of references that a student must have, changing the *Expertise Threshold*.
